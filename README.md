# SunPy and Python Tutorials

The purpose of this repository is to catalog all tutorials and materials
available about SunPy and Python. Some of the materials are contained directly
in this repository while some materials live in their own repository but are
linked from here. **This is not meant to be used by users to learn how to use
SunPy as many examples are out of date.** This is meant to be an archive to
help develop future tutorials.

# Recommendations

The following section provides some recommendations for tutorials. For all of
the times listed below it should always be recognized that many users will
arrive without having Python or SunPy installed and will need help. It is
always recommended to have people in addition to the speaker available to work
with people individually.

| time available | topics | notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| 1 hour         | intro to SunPy notebook | advanced users may be able to follow along with the notebook many will just watch. This should be seen as a pitch for what kinds of things SunPy can do |
| 1 hour         | Intro to Scientific Python | same as above |
| 2 hours        | intro to SunPy notebook (1 hour) and exercises (1 hour) OR Intro to Scientific Python (1 hour) and Intro to SunPy (1 hour) |

# Example Tutorials

# Generic Resources
This provides generic resources to materials that are available on the web.
Given the active nature of the ecosystem some of these resources may be out of
date.
